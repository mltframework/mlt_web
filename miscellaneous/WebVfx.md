WebVfx is an
external MLT module that uses Qt to let one implement producers, filters,
and transitions using HTML5 and QML technologies. It was originally written
by Andrew Wason ([github](http://rectalogic.github.io/webvfx)). MLT now
maintains it on [GitHub](https://github.com/mltframework/webvfx)
and added Qt 5 compatibility and various fixes needed during
[Shotcut](https://www.shotcut.org/) integration.
