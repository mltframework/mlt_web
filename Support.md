If you need help with a bug, then please use the [bug tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/issues).

Community support is available in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/discussions).

There is a [mlt tag on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlt), but that gets less attention to people in the know about MLT and more attention from people who are not helpful.

Also, you may want to check the [FAQ]({{"/faq/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
