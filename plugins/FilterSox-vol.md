## Parameters

### effect

title: Options    
type: string  
readonly: no  
required: no  
format: GAIN [TYPE [LIMITERGAIN]]
	(default TYPE=amplitude: 1 is constant, < 0 change phase;
	TYPE=power 1 is constant; TYPE=dB: 0 is constant, +6 doubles ampl.)
	The peak limiter has a gain much less than 1 (e.g. 0.05 or 0.02) and
	is only used on peaks (to prevent clipping); default is no limiter.
