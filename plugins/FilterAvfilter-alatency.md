media types:
Audio  
description: Report audio filtering latency.  
version: Lavfi11.4.100

Many parameters support animated values (keyframes) but only the numeric ones. Many numeric properties have type string because they accept an expression (see FFmpeg documentation) even though they evaluate to a numeric value.
