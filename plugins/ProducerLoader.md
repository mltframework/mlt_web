## Plugin Information

media types:

description: This producer has two roles:
1. it handles the mappings of all file names to the other producers;
2. it attaches normalizing filters (rescale, resize and resample) to the producers (when necessary).
This producer simplifies many aspects of use. Essentially, it ensures that a consumer will receive images and audio precisely as they request them.
