## Plugin Information

title: Composite (*DEPRECATED*)  
media types:
Video  
description: A key-framable alpha-channel compositor for two frames.  
version: 2  
creator: Dan Dennedy  
copyright: Meltytech, LLC  
license: LGPLv2.1  

## Notes

Deprecated: use &quot;affine&quot; or &quot;qtblend&quot; instead. Performs dissolves and luma wipes in addition to alpha compositing.
By default, the aspect ratio of the B frame is respected and the size portion of the geometry specification simply defines a bounding rectangle.
This performs field-based rendering unless the A frame property &quot;progressive&quot; or &quot;consumer_progressive&quot; or the transition property &quot;progressive&quot; is set to 1.


## Bugs

* Assumes lower field first during field rendering.
