## Plugin Information

title: Audio Spectrum Filter  
media types:
Video  
description: An audio visualization filter that draws an audio spectrum on the image.  
version: 1

## Parameters

### type

title: Graph type    
description:
The type of graph to display the spectrum.  
type: string  
readonly: no  
required: no  
default: line  
widget: combo  
values:  

* line
* bar

### bgcolor

title: Background Color    
description:
<pre>
The background color to be applied to the entire frame. The default color
is transparent.

A color value is a hexadecimal representation of RGB plus alpha channel
as 0xrrggbbaa. Colors can also be the words: white, black, red, green,
or blue. You can also use a HTML-style color values #rrggbb or #aarrggbb.
</pre>
type: color  
readonly: no  
required: no  
animation: yes  
widget: color  

### color.*

title: Foreground color    
description:
<pre>
The color of the waveform.

Multiple colors can be specified with incrementing suffixes to cause the
waveform to be drawn in a gradient. color.1 is the top of the waveform.
Subsequent colors will produce a gradient toward the bottom.

By default, the filter has one color defined:

    color.1=0xffffffff"

This results in a white waveform.

To create a gradient, define more colors:

    color.2=green color.3=0x77777777

A color value is a hexadecimal representation of RGB plus alpha channel
as 0xrrggbbaa. Colors can also be the words: white, black, red, green,
or blue. You can also use a HTML-style color values #rrggbb or #aarrggbb.
</pre>
type: color

### rect

title: Rectangle    
description:
<pre>
Defines the rectangle that the waveform(s) should be drawn in.
Format is: "X Y W H".
X, Y, W, H are assumed to be pixel units unless they have the suffix '%'.
</pre>
type: rect  
readonly: no  
required: no  
animation: yes  
default: 0 0 100% 100%  

### fill

title: Fill    
description:
Whether the area under the waveform should be filled in. Only applies to line graph type.  
type: boolean

default: 0  
widget: checkbox  

### reverse

title: Reverse    
description:
Draw the points starting with the highest frequency first.  
type: boolean  
readonly: no  
required: no  
default: 0  
widget: checkbox  

### tension

title: Line Tension    
description:
Affects the amount of curve in the line interpolating between points. 0.0 = a straight line between points. 1.0 = very curved lines between points. values &lt; 0 and &gt; 1 will cause loops in the lines. Only applies to line graph type.

maximum: 100  
default: 10  
unit: pixels  

### bands

title: Points    
description:
The number of bands to draw in the spectrum. Each band shows up as a data point in the graph.  
type: integer  
readonly: no  
required: no  
animation: yes  
default: 31  

### frequency_low
