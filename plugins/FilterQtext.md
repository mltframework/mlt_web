### html

description:
Render rich text from a string containing a subset of HTML 4. The only other properties that can be used with this are geometry and bgcolour.

This property has a higher priority than argument; argument is ignored if this property is set.  
type: string  
readonly: no  
required: no  

### resource

title: HTML File    
description:
Render rich text from a file containing a subset of HTML 4. The only other properties that can be used with this are geometry and bgcolour.

This property has a higher priority than both argument and html; argument and html are ignored if this property is set.  
type: string  
readonly: no  
required: no  

### _hide

title: Hide

### overflow-y

type: boolean  
readonly: no  
required: no  

### pixel_ratio

title: Pixel Ratio    
description:
This option applies only when using html or resource properties. It adds a scaling factor to the rendering. This can be used to help to make MLT&#39;s output match a user interface. NOTE: this property is only used on Windows because it is the only platform found thus far that has different rendering behavior relative to device pixel ratio.  
type: float  
readonly: no  
required: no  
minimum: 1.0  
default: 1.0
