## Plugin Information

title: Opacity (GLSL)  
media types:
Video  
description: Adjust the opacity of an image through the alpha channel.  
version: 1  
creator: Steinar H. Gunderson  
copyright: Dan Dennedy  
license: GPLv2  

## Notes

When used in some transitions this will cause this video to be mixed with the other video. If the video this is applied to already has an alpha channel, then this preserves that by multiplying the opacity level with the alpha channel. This filter is especially handy when used in conjunction with movit.overlay. You can also use this to fade a clip from and to black.

description:
