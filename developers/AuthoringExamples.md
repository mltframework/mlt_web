You can find examples of how to author in melt or xml syntax by looking
in the [demo subdirectory](https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/tree/master/demo)
of the tarball. The examples are in melt syntax, but you can easily convert
them to XML. For example,

```$ source mlt_audio_stuff -consumer xml
```
