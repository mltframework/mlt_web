#### Contributing Code

The preferred way to receive code changes is by publishing your git repo
and telling Main.DanDennedy or the mailing list whenever you have
something new or have updated something worthy of notice.

Otherwise, send patches to the
[mailing list](https://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=96039).
All patches must be in the unified diff format. Short patches can be in
the body of the message. Long patches should be attached. Use your best
judgment.

Make sure code submissions conform to the [Style Guide]({{ "/docs/codingstyleguide/" | prepend: site.baseurl }})
and [Copyright Policy]({{ "/docs/copyrightpolicy/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
