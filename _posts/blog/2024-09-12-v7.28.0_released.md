You can [download it from GitHub](https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/releases/tag/v7.28.0).

This fixes a couple of major regressions in the previous version 7.26.0:
  * Fixed seeking and frozen video due by reverting "Improved performance with
    intra-only video and reducing the frame rate."
  * Fixed using `melt` to render MLT XML with OpenGL effects from `movit`.

Other fixes and changes:
  * Deprecated the `composite` transition and the `sdl` and `ndi` modules.
  * Fixed Android camera video has the wrong frame rate (broken in v7.26.0).
  * Fixed audio not playing for audio-only DTS WMA.
  * Fixed using "https:" URLs in the `xml` producer.
  * Fixed crash on exit when running `melt -query` or `melt -query links`.
  * Added a `transition` property to the `watermark` filter. Now, it defaults
    to using `affine`.
  * Changed `affine` transition argument to set `rect` property if supplied.
